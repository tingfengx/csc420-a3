CSC420 Assignment #3
Tingfeng Xia (1003780884)

Since you are here, you should have already unzipped
the Assignment 3 folder...

To run my code, ```cd``` into the ```Assignment 3``` 
folder, and run ```jupyter notebook```. The notebook 
containing my code is named ```a3-code.ipynb```. All 
my code for this assignment is inside this ipython 
notebook, and all code inside are clearly labeled for 
which question they were answering. Also, I've printed
the notebook into a pdf file, which is available as 
```a3-code.pdf```. (so that you can view the code 
without having to start up a jupyter server. :D )
